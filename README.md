# NeoVim Configuration

This is my own custom NeoVim configuration built using [jdhao's configuration](https://github.com/jdhao/nvim-config) as a foundation.
I would strongly advise against using this configuration yourself, because:

- It is likely to change significantly and suddenly based purely on what I fancy trying out.
- Building your own nvim config is a great learning experience, and will give you a greater understanding and appreciation for your editor.

The bootstrap script provided will work for either Arch Linux or MacOS. This configuration will work on other operating systems, although I do not intend to write bootstrap scripts for operating systems which I do not use.
