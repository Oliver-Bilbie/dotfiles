# NeoVim Configuration

This is my own custom NeoVim configuration built using [jdhao's configuration](https://github.com/jdhao/nvim-config) as a foundation.
I would strongly advise against using this configuration yourself, because:
- It is likely to change significantly and suddenly based purely on what I fancy trying out.
- Building your own nvim config is a great learning experience, and will give you a deeper understanding and appreciation for your editor.
